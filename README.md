# Save Warp TASing

This repository hosts the TAS and warp chain scripts for full-game save-warping TASes I have completed for GoldSrc games, as well as recorded demos from executing those TASes.

As I am a novice TASer, and given how the pain of TASing save warping incentivizes expedience over detail for non-warping segments, there will definitely be room for improvements in any TAS posted here. Anyone with more GoldSrc TASing experience is welcome to fork any TAS herein to make those improvements themselves, should they be willing.
